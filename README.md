# Pokemon-Battle-Sim-Basic

## A cool exercise to wind down my #100DaysofCode.
I wanted to make a Pokemon Battle Sim to work more with objects and learn a bit more about JQuery. 

## Issues
You cannot have both players pick the same pokemon. For whatever reason, the sprite for Player 1 disappears, even though the pokemonChoice for player 1 is logged as the same pokemon. It's present, but the sprite is not. 

Need to connect the actual values of the Moves to the buttons.
